# EPGo

subredit: [epgo](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpGo/)

## Features

- Cache function to download only new EPG data
- No database is required
- Update EPG with CLI command for using your own scripts

## Requirements

- [Schedules Direct](https://www.schedulesdirect.org/ "Schedules Direct") Account
- Computer with 1-2 GB memory
- [Go](https://golang.org/ "Golang") 1.21+ to build the binary
- [Optional] Docker to run it in a containerized environment

## Installation

### Option 1 -- Build Binary

Run the following commands inside the source code folder:

```bash
go mod tidy
go build epgo
```

This produces a binary named `epgo` for your OS.

For a smaller production binary:

```bash
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o epgo
```

To cross-compile (e.g., for Linux on AMD64):

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o epgo_linux_amd64
```

### Option 2 -- Docker

Clone the repo and use the provided `docker-compose.yaml`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chuchodavids/EpGo.git
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml
services:
  epgo:
    container_name: epgo
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        # Or amd64
        - TARGETARCH=arm64
    environment:
      - TZ=America/Chicago
    volumes:
      # Assumes config.yaml is in the same directory as this docker-compose.yaml
      - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml
    command: -config /app/config.yaml
    restart: never
```

The Docker image is built from the included `Dockerfile`, which downloads the latest release binary from GitHub.

### Option 3 -- Download Binary

Go to [releases](https://github.com/Chuchodavids/EpGo/releases) and download the binary for your platform. You can also use the `download.sh` script included in the repository.

## Using the APP

```epgo -h```

```bash
-config string
    = Get data from Schedules Direct with configuration file. [filename.yaml]
-configure string
    = Create or modify the configuration file. [filename.yaml]
-serve string
    = Start a local HTTP server to serve files from the specified directory. [directory:port]
-version
    = shows the current version (v3.2.1)
-h  : Show help
```

### Create a config file

**note**: You can use the sample config file that is in the /config folder inside of the docker container

```epgo -configure MY_CONFIG_FILE.yaml```  
If the configuration file does not exist, a YAML configuration file is created. 

**Configuration file from version 1.0.6 or earlier is not compatible.**  

#### Terminal Output

```txt
Configuration [MY_CONFIG_FILE.yaml]
-----------------------------
 1. Schedules Direct Account
 2. Add Lineup
 3. Remove Lineup
 4. Manage Channels
 5. Create XMLTV File [MY_CONFIG_FILE.xml]
 0. Exit
```

##### Follow the instructions in the terminal

1. Schedules Direct Account:  
Manage Schedules Direct credentials.  

2. Add Lineup:  
Add Lineup into the Schedules Direct account.  

3. Remove Lineup:  
Remove Lineup from the Schedules Direct account.  

4. Manage Channels:  
Selection of the channels to be used.
You can now choose to add all channels from a lineup at once or select them individually.
All selected channels are merged into one XML file when the XMLTV file is created.
When using all channels from all lineups it is recommended to create a separate epgo configuration file for each lineup.  
5. Create XMLTV File [MY_CONFIG_FILE.xml]:  
Creates the XMLTV file with the selected channels.  

**Example:**

Lineup 1:

```bash
epgo -configure Config_Lineup_1.yaml
```

Lineup 2:

```bash
epgo -configure Config_Lineup_2.yaml
```

### Files: (Can be customized)**

```yaml
Cache: /app/file.json  
XMLTV: /app/xml  
```

### Server: (Can be customized)

```yaml
Enable: false
Address: localhost
Port: "80"
```

-   **Enable**: `true` or `false` to enable or disable the image server.
-   **Address**: The IP address or hostname for the server to listen on. Defaults to `localhost`.
-   **Port**: The port for the server to listen on. Defaults to `80`.

### Options: (Can be customized)

**Some clients only use one image, even if there are several in the XMLTV file.**  

---

```yaml
Schedule Days: 7
```

EPG data for the specified days. Schedules Direct has EPG data for the next 12-14 days  

---

```yaml
Live and New icons: false
```

**true:** Appends a unicode superscript "LIVE" or "New" badge to the programme title for live broadcasts and first-run episodes, respectively.

---

```yaml
Subtitle into Description: false
```

Some clients only display the description and ignore the subtitle tag from the XMLTV file.  

**true:** If there is a subtitle, it will be added to the description.

### Images: (Can be customized)

```yaml
Download Images from Schedules Direct: false
Insert typed image tags into XML file: false
Image Path: ""
Delete images unused for days. 0 to keep all: 0
Image links as local files: false
```

-   **Download Images from Schedules Direct**: `true` or `false`. If `true`, images will be downloaded to the `Image Path`. If `Image Path` is not set, it will default to a folder named `images`.
-   **Image Path**: The path where the images will be downloaded. If Schedules Direct reports the daily image limit, no more images are requested until it resets the counter at 00:00 UTC, also in later runs.
-   **Delete images unused for days. 0 to keep all**: Defaults to `0`, which never deletes images. With a number of days, each run deletes downloaded images that no programme in the guide has used for that many days. Files that are not images are left alone. If a run finds no images at all, nothing is deleted. Only the guide counts as use: if a client keeps image links, like Tvheadend does for recordings, update the modification time of those files before each run or they are deleted too.
-   **Image links as local files**: Defaults to `false`, which links images through the image server (`http://<Server Address>:<Port>/<file>`). With `true`, images are linked as `file://` URLs to the `Image Path`, for clients on the same machine that serve local images themselves (Tvheadend serves `file://` images to its clients). The image server is not needed then.
-   **Insert typed image tags into XML file**: Defaults to `false`. With this and **Download Images from Schedules Direct** enabled, adds XMLTV `<image>` elements alongside the unchanged `<icon>` selection. Images use the same local image server URLs and download limits as icons; shared files are downloaded only once. Failed downloads are omitted, and Schedules Direct account/token/limit errors stop further downloads for the run (already cached files remain usable).

Typed images select Episode-tier Iconic art for `still`, Season-tier Iconic art (falling back to Series) for `backdrop`, and Season-tier Banner-L1 art (falling back to Series) for `poster`. Movies use Poster Art for `poster` and their Iconic art for `backdrop`. Sport and team events without Iconic art use Backdrop-Sports for `backdrop`; other Sport Event/Team Event art is not mapped. Missing types are omitted; The MovieDB fallback still applies only to `<icon>`.

Within each tier, selection prefers 16:9, then 2:3, 4:3, 3:4, 2:1 and square images; movie posters prefer 2:3 before 16:9. Other aspects are a last resort. The largest width wins within an aspect, like the icon selection. Each image has `system="schedulesdirect"`, orientation from its dimensions (`P` portrait or `L` landscape; square uses `L`), and XMLTV size `1` for a largest dimension below 200px, `2` for 200–400px, or `3` above 400px. URLs never contain the Schedules Direct token.

#### The MovieDB

```yaml
The MovieDB:
    Enable: false
    Api Key: ""
```

-   **Enable**: `true` or `false` to enable or disable The MovieDB as a fallback image source.
-   **Api Key**: Your The MovieDB API key.

The TMDB cache file (default: `config_tmdb_cache.json`) persists search results to avoid redundant API calls.

```yaml
Insert credits tag into XML file: false
```

**true:** Adds the credits (director, actor, producer, writer) to the program information, if available.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<programme channel="epgo.67203.schedulesdirect.org" start="20200509134500 +0000" stop="20200509141000 +0000">

```yaml
Rating:
        Insert rating tag into XML file: true
        ...
```

**true:** Adds the TV parental guidelines to the program information.  

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<programme channel="epgo.67203.schedulesdirect.org" start="20200509134500 +0000" stop="20200509141000 +0000">
  <title lang="de">Two and a Half Men</title>
  <sub-title lang="de">Ich arbeite für Caligula</sub-title>
  <language>de</language>
  ...
  <rating system="Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft">
    <value>12</value>
  </rating>
   ...
</programme>
```

**false:** TV parental guidelines are not used. Further rating settings are ignored.  

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<programme channel="epgo.67203.schedulesdirect.org" start="20200509134500 +0000" stop="20200509141000 +0000">
  <title lang="de">Two and a Half Men</title>
  <sub-title lang="de">Ich arbeite für Caligula</sub-title>
  <language>de</language>
   ...
</programme>
```

```yaml
Rating:
        ...
        Maximum rating entries. 0 for all entries: 1
        ...
```

Specifies the number of maximum rating entries. If the value is 0, all parental guidelines available from Schedules Direct are used. Depending on the preferred countries.

```yaml
Rating:
        ...
        Preferred countries. ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code. Leave empty for all systems:
          - DEU
          - CHE
          - USA
        ...
```

Sets the order of the preferred countries [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3 "ISO 3166-1 alpha-3").  
Parental guidelines are not available for every country and program information. Trial and error.  
If no country is specified, all available countries are used. Many clients ignore a list with more than one entry or use the first entry.  

**If no country is specified:**  
If a rating entry exists in the same language as the Schedules Direct Lineup, it will be set to the top. In this example German (DEU).  

Lineup: **DEU**-1000097-DEFAULT  
1st rating system (Germany): Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft  

```xml
...
<rating system="Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft">
  <value>12</value>
</rating>
<rating system="USA Parental Rating">
  <value>TV14</value>
</rating>
...
```

```yaml
Rating:
        ...
        Use country code as rating system: false
```

**true:**

```xml
<rating system="DEU">
  <value>12</value>
</rating>
<rating system="USA">
  <value>TV14</value>
</rating>

```

**false:**

```xml
<rating system="Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft">
  <value>12</value>
</rating>
<rating system="USA Parental Rating">
  <value>TV14</value>
</rating>
```

---

```txt
Show download errors from Schedules Direct in the log: false
```

**true:** Shows incorrect downloads of Schedules Direct in the log.  

Example:

```bash
2020/07/18 19:10:53 [ERROR] Could not find requested image. Post message to http://forums.schedulesdirect.org/viewforum.php?f=6 if you are having issues. [SD API Error Code: 5000] Program ID: EP03481925
```

---

## LCN (Logical Channel Number)

Each channel in the XMLTV output includes an `lcn` attribute for subchannel auto-matching in media servers like Plex and Jellyfin. The LCN is populated from the Schedules Direct lineup map — for OTA channels it uses `atscMajor.atscMinor`, and for cable/satellite it uses the channel number string.

```xml
<channel id="epgo.42635.schedulesdirect.org">
  <display-name>WGBO-DT</display-name>
  <display-name>66.1</display-name>
  <lcn>66.1</lcn>
  <icon src="https://...png" width="360" height="270"/>
</channel>
```

---

## Image Server

When `Server.Enable` is set to `true` in the config, the HTTP image server starts automatically after XMLTV generation in `-config` mode. You can also start it independently with the `-serve` flag:

```bash
./epgo -serve /path/to/images:8080
```

---

## Cron Scheduling

To keep EPG data up to date, run EPGo on a schedule. Example crontab entries:

```
@reboot /app/epgo --config /data/livetv/config.yaml
00 * * * * /app/epgo --config /data/livetv/config.yaml
```

A `cronjob` file with these examples is included in the repository.

---

## Cache Cleanup

After each XMLTV generation, stale program and metadata entries are automatically purged from the cache file. This keeps the cache size manageable without manual intervention.

### Create the XMLTV file using the command line (CLI): 

```bash
epgo -config MY_CONFIG_FILE.yaml
```

**The configuration file must have already been created.**
